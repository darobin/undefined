The data for these books is extracted from the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/) with a 
fall-back to [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/) when data is not found. The data is stored here
for caching purposes but the original licenses apply.

Extraction details can be found in the `books-extractor.js` script found in this directory.
