    With the best effort I can hardly convey within this short space my excitement about somewhat
    sprawling areas of knowledge and action. As a proxy to that, I list here a selection of some
    books I have read (<span class="book-read">&nbsp;</span>), am reading
    (<span class="book-reading">&nbsp;</span>), or have in my ongoing reading pile
    (<span class="book-to-read">&nbsp;</span>).
