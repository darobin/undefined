  - There is a fine line between ambitious theorising and crackpot ideas. The ambition I have in
    approaching this topic is certainly well within the danger zone.
  - My planned approach is to start small and try to discover small improvements. The goal should
    remain bold, but progress should be made in steps.
  - The smallest starting point is to start reproducing a number of code experiments in which order
    appears out of randomness (Bak's avalanches or critical brain, Kauffman's NK models and random
    Boolean networks come to mind, s/b models) in a context that makes them hackable (and with simple
    explanations). The idea is to enable simple tinkering based on minimal expertise. This could
    enable not only better intuitions but also contribute to greater literacy on the topic.

  - HACK: Bak's avalanches here, as a demo?

  - There have been many experiments showing that interesting order emerges from simple, random
    systems. In at least some cases, this order appears to be a major force in shaping what systems
    can arise and evolve naturally — including, according to SK in The Origins of Order, imposing
    limits on natural selection's power to shape beings.
  - If such emergent order is a fundamental force in the universe, there is no reason to believe that
    it may not act equally in many disparate parts of reality, in physics just as much as in biology;
    in fast mental processes just as much as in slow evolutionary ones.
