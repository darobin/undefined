  <h3>Why There Must Be Something</h3>
  
  

  <!--
    - There is a fine line between ambitious theorising and crackpot ideas. The ambition I have in
      approaching this topic is certainly well within the danger zone.
    - My planned approach is to start small and try to discover small improvements. The goal should
      remain bold, but progress should be made in steps.
    - The smallest starting point is to start reproducing a number of code experiments in which order
      appears out of randomness (Bak's avalanches or critical brain, Kauffman's NK models and random
      Boolean networks come to mind, s/b models) in a context that makes them hackable (and with simple
      explanations). The idea is to enable simple tinkering based on minimal expertise. This could
      enable not only better intuitions but also contribute to greater literacy on the topic.

    - HACK: Bak's avalanches here, as a demo? If so, make sure to put it close to the start of the
      article, and the article at the top of the essays

    - There have been many experiments showing that interesting order emerges from simple, random
      systems. In at least some cases, this order appears to be a major force in shaping what systems
      can arise and evolve naturally — including, according to SK in The Origins of Order, imposing
      limits on natural selection's power to shape beings.
    - If such emergent order is a fundamental force in the universe, there is no reason to believe that
      it may not act equally in many disparate parts of reality, in physics just as much as in biology;
      in fast mental processes just as much as in slow evolutionary ones.

    - detail the full research programme
    - still in very early stages since it is put together on a very small amount of time
    - Descartes: "realised that it was necessary, once in a lifetime [semel in vita], to demolish
      everything completely and start again right from the foundations if I wanted to establish
      anything at all in the sciences that was stable and likely to last." (Mediations)


    And by this means there is obtained as great variety as possible, along with the greatest
    possible order; that is to say, it is the way to get as much perfection as possible.
