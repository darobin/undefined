<!--
  - There is a fine line between ambitious theorising and crackpot ideas. The ambition I have in
    approaching this topic is certainly well within the danger zone.
  - My planned approach is to start small and try to discover small improvements. The goal should
    remain bold, but progress should be made in steps.
  - The smallest starting point is to start reproducing a number of code experiments in which order
    appears out of randomness (Bak's avalanches or critical brain, Kauffman's NK models and random
    Boolean networks come to mind) in a context that makes them hackable (and with simple
    explanations). The idea is to enable simple tinkering based on minimal expertise. This could
    enable not only better intuitions but also contribute to greater literacy on the topic.
  - HACK: Bak's avalanches here, as a demo?
