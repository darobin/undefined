  <p>
    I deliberately chose here not to describe a single, ready-to-go research programme. Instead, I
    sought to demonstrate a variety of short and somewhat rough ideas. My hope is not to add a brick
    to the Media Labâ€™s edifice but rather to plug into its full complexity, and through that to help
    beautiful new things into being, to help deliver the promises of our times.
