  - yet the necessity of a machine-processable web of data is as real as ever
  - there has been progress, but it is largely in the hands of the big search engines that make use
    of Microdata/RDFa
  - CommonCrawl help
  - we need to increase data *mungeability*
  - the CSV project helps
  - transition thinking
  - data to the people
  - instead of picture, use pretty quote about "then it's overhyped, then you can do something with
    it" with hanging quotes and all

    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_syndrome">Galápagos syndrome</a>,
    derived from Darwin’s observations of how species had walked down their own evolutionary path in
    the isolated environment of the Galápagos islands, was initially coined to describe the manner
    in which Japanese phones were for over a decade featuring advanced capabilities that were rarely
    spread abroad. It can however be equally well applied in other contexts. The French
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel">Minitel</a> is one such example. Semantic Web
    technologies are another, which is a major factor in their currently relatively limited
    deployment.

    XXX
    there have been improvements: JSON-LD, CSV, Microdata/RDFa (explain each a tiny bit)
