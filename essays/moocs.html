<!--
  - bite sized learning: it's silly to assume people will always want a full hour on a broad topic,
    let alone a whole course. People need to be able to learn just the smallest part, with links to
    dependencies; and of course it's possible to turn a set of bite-sized courses into a full course
  - Wikipedia is pretty bad for learning something, but there could very well be a wikipedia for
    learning
