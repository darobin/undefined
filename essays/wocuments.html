  <h3>Self-Editable Documents</h3>

  <p>
    Digital documents today come in either of two kinds. They can be <em>packaged documents</em>, in
    which case they are generally available as files on one’s hard drive, and can be copied and
    emailed around. Each type of packaged document requires a specialised application to view or
    edit them (often the same for both, but not necessarily). It is not uncommon for such
    applications to become bloated with features one does not need and to increase in complexity
    beyond the preferences of most users. A good example is Microsoft Office. Or they can be
    <em>hosted documents</em>, sitting on a third-party’s server. Hosted documents can frequently be
    shown to others who need not run anything other than a Web browser, but their content is in
    someone else’s keep with the obvious implications this has for security, privacy, and
    persistence. One instance of such an approach is Google Docs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We should not have to choose between ease of use and privacy, between universality and data
    ownership.
  </p>
  <p>
    Self-editable documents are documents that contain both their content and the implementation
    that makes it possible to render and edit them. Hosted documents have demonstrated that the Web
    platform is powerful enough for advanced document editing, and SEDs avail themselves of this
    capability. They are simply interactive Web content packaged up in a neat exchangeable file, and
    brought to life by a single runtime for all such documents which is essentially a browser view
    into the package. Carrying around the editing implementation with every document will have only
    a minor impact on size as the brunt of the complexity resides in the Web runtime; most editing
    environments can be supported with a few hundred kilobytes of JavaScript; the simpler ones less
    so.
  </p>
  <p>
    One first value of SEDs is the diversity they enable: no matter how abstruse my choices in
    editing setup, I can still send others the document and they will be able to read it. This has
    an impact on archivability as well since a single format built atop Open Web technologies is
    essentially archivable in perpetuity, with no necessity to find a copy of a discontinued
    editor that only runs on an ancient operating system.
  </p>
  <p>
    This diversity also enables specialisation. Using the same editor for letters and novels,
    reports and speeches, specifications and articles, vector art and holiday cards leads to poor
    user experiences. Thanks to the format’s universality, one can have an very simple editor
    dedicated to letters and another, different one for structured long-form. And there is no need
    to remember which application is used for what type of file: a new document is created simply by
    copying an existing one and replacing the content.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to foster a thriving ecosystem of SED types, it is possible for the rendering code to
    be runnable by all while the editing code requires the acquisition of a license. This maintains
    the universality of the format while providing economic incentives for the creation of high
    quality self-editable document types.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond simple convenience this approach is the only one that comes to mind with the ability to
    break the stranglehold of Microsoft, Adobe, Google, and other such large players over the
    document space. <span class="end">•</span>
