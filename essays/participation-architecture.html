  - a lot has been tried in the social space (not just networking, collaboration etc. also matter, open projects)
  - for the longest time we were naïve: just open and they will come
  - this failed many, but also succeeded much
  - we are starting to get interesting models, notably for social networking, and they are in part
    being applied to solving practical problems (for instance filtering the FB newsfeed so that it
    scales)
  - but I have not yet seen a focus on using this knowledge to *build* such systems from scratch
    - given known successful topologies for specific problems, how do you create them?
  - essentially, we want to head towards Memetic Engineering (except you want that mentioned in the
    first paragraph as it really is an eye-catcher)

  - failure, success: who knows why?
  - mention previous work (cover, link to PUF)
  - naïve
  - network diagrams
  - the titans of the day are still struggling with information filtering. Facebook works well as
    a network in that it tends to parallel that which is found in the analog world, but it is still
    struggling with the fact that beyond a few dozen friends one cannot have a timeline that is the
    entirety of one’s immediate network talking all at once. And their attempts at filtering are
    rather evidently dysfunctional. Proper percolation of information across linked people is the
    as-yet unfulfilled promise of social networking. Without it the domain only seems sustainable
    if users regularly migrate to the next shiny system.

  - "We still don't know how to design medium or large-scale participatory and decisive
    environments. As an example, the W3C, despite two decades of experience and
    experimentation, remains too often a great mechanism to make the right decision once it
    has been overtaken by events."
  - How to design for participation?
  - mention previous work on political organisation (with retrospective caveats)
  - The fundamental question today about participation architecture is: Why is it that some
    participatory projects become huge successes in which a large community self-organises
    seemingly spontaneously whereas other projects with similar openness either never take off
    or degenerate into chaos, spam, and trolling?
  - The problem is that it is not about being participatory, and it certainly isn't about
    openness. It is about how the participation network is structured.
  - What matters is to set up a participatory architecture that naturally fosters Small World
    networking topologies. These are efficient for action, coordination, dissemination of
    useful information, and filtering. Compared to extreme alternatives such as hierarchical
    pyramids, closed off small islands, or the noise of fully-connected networks these have
    clear advantages. It's the difference between social networks and corporate-mandated
    social networks (that are dead) or blog and YouTube comments (that are basically
    unstructured).
  - That is where the value of hybrid people, not necessarily those known to be highly
    connected but those who create links between heterogeneous groups, appear as most valuable
  - From this essential hypothesis we need to construct a science of participation
    architecture, so much of the Web's future relies on it
  - Participation and openness are not without value however: they fuel the network and lead
    to scale. It is simply that they only work when the network grows with the proper
    topology.
  - There are known methods to foster growth that structures the network in useful manners.
    The best known is preferential attachment but there are other known mechanisms that
    produce SW networks. We need to understand them and how to deploy them. We can then
    proceed to experimentation.
  - Make this a research programme.
  - In many ways, the initial Google search approach was little more than applied sociology,
    from the initial Milgram findings and developments built atop it.
  - mention issues with Liquid Democracy and its superdelegation model (categorisation); also
    point out problems with rule complexity that enables gaming of the system (e.g. French
    Greens)
  - Facebook had a natural source of SW nets (since it reflected reality up to a point) that
    worked really well for some parts, but this did not extend to the user's timeline which
    exposed all the network's content at once (rather than working through the filters that
    real-world SW nets have built-in). Their more recent attempts to automatically curate the
    news feed seem ham-fisted and unnatural in the results they produce; whether that is
    because they cannot easily reproduce the natural filtering of reality (in which your
    friends are never all in the same room at once) is an interesting question.
    
  - the role of morals?

    The question of how to organise groups into a harmonious, cooperative ensemble is not new. But
    whereas frameworks for instance described in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_%28Aristotle%29">Aristotle’s
    <cite>Politics</cite></a> or experimented with in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanst%C3%A8re">Fourier’s Phalanstère</a> tended towards
    requiring the full commitment of one’s energies, the appearance of the Web has made tinkering
    with collective organisation much easier.

  <!--
    and tinker we have
    there are not enough clichés in the world to convey the impact of the Web in social experimentation
    but we have done so naïvely
    in this I point no fingers: my own publication about applying the practices of open standards to
    politics now seems hopelessly naïve
    yet the optimism remains
    research has much improved: reading Milgram’s experiment a few decades ago and contrasting it
    with the type of research done today into the organisation of society and trying to find what
    works is heartening
    but the core question remains: how do we design for participation?
    it is time to turn the research into action and to find out how we can convert the analysis we
    have into actual design decisions for collective services. if it were to surface that successful
    collective services are all structured around a SW network, the question becomes: how do we
    design interactions and structure the flow of information such that SW would naturally emerge
    in the service?
    This is no easy task. Facebook for instance is clearly floundering in its attempt to make its
    timeline — an unstructured all-to-one feature — usable despite the actual connections between
    its users having a genuine social topology
    boiling the ocean is unlikely to work here; but creating small, targeted Web experiments 
    following modest but world-improving goals should progressively inform the craft of participation
    architecture
