    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_syndrome">Galápagos syndrome</a>,
    derived from Darwin’s observations of how species had walked down their own evolutionary path in
    the isolated environment of the Galápagos islands, was initially coined to describe the manner
    in which Japanese phones were for over a decade featuring advanced capabilities that were rarely
    spread abroad. It can however be equally well applied in other contexts. The French
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel">Minitel</a> is one such example. Semantic Web
    technologies, having largely grown in isolation from the rest of Web technology, are another,
    which is a major factor in their currently relatively limited deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet the necessity of a machine-processable Web of data is as real as ever. Open data continues
    to become massively available, but without an increase in widespread ability to process it
    easily its power goes largely untapped. The hugely diverse data sets that are bound to be
    produced by connected objects can only make the issue more pressing. Unused data is but a waste
    of bits; in order to enable a new generation of services on the Web we need to increase
    <em>data mungeability</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There have been improvements. JSON-LD has opened a tenuous bridge between Semantic Web
    technologies and run-of-the-mill Web development; ongoing work to turn sturdy old CSV into a
    first-class Web format will help further; and the slow but steady growth of Microdata and RDFa
    embedded in Web documents is progressively granting search engines power beyond text and links
    processing. But most of the benefits are so far being reaped by the large search engines rather
    than by a broader population. The <a href="http://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> can help,
    but only so far as data is published on typical Web sites.
  </p>
  <p>
    The causes behind this mismatch are not specific to Semantic Web technologies. As a community we
    need to become much better at <em>transition thinking</em>. It is never enough to just solve a
    problem by inventing technology: one also needs to know how to get people from here to there. In
    other words everyone might want a flying car, but if it requires years of intensive training to
    use it, no matter how great the antigrav engine, no matter how many dream of it, no matter that
    it may be enough to fend off global warming it will still fail. Technology is first and foremost
    a behavioural science.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of the <em>Web Schema</em> project is to reboot the Semantic Web by rooting a new batch
    of data technology in the vernacular of everyday Web development. The primary use case is to
    enable developers to start from what they typically already have — a JSON-based API — and allow
    them to enhance it iteratively in a manner that serves their immediate interests in producing
    Web content.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Web Schema models data in a manner that is at the natural intersection between JSON formats
    and HTML forms, with default rules that lend themselves to progressive enhancements (as opposed
    to having to produce a data ontology from scratch). Through this, it enables data validation on
    both the server (for security) and the client (for usability), it makes it possible to generate
    forms, to optimise database storage, and to document Web APIs. These features make Web Schema
    directly useful to developers, and by providing enhanced data descriptions in a manner that is
    built-in rather than bolted-on (as with traditional metadata) it provides a natural
    bootstrapping step to a Web of much higher quality data for all to use. <span
