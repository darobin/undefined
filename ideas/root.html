  <p>
    I deliberately chose here not to describe a single, ready-to-go research programme. Instead, I
    sought to demonstrate a variety of short and somewhat rough ideas. My hope is not to add a brick
    to the Media Lab’s edifice but rather to plug into its full complexity, and through that to help
    beautiful new things into being, to help deliver the promises of our times.
