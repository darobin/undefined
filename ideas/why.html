  <h3>Why There Must Be Something</h3>
  <p>
    I have a keen interest in the emergence of order, not within the study objects of a specific
    discipline but as a general topic. Eventually, I would like to answer the classic question:
    «<em>Why is there something rather than nothing?</em>».
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a fine line between ambitious theorising and crackpot ideas. The ambition I have in
    approaching this topic is certainly well within the danger zone. I am starting small and hoping
    to being by discovering small improvements; departing neither from the bold goal nor from the
    contact of reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    My preferred starting point is to focus on simple code-based experiments (e.g. Per Bak’s
    avalanches or critical brain, Stuart Kauffman’s <var>NK</var> models or random boolean networks,
    John Holland’s signals/boundaries modes come to mind). Reproducing them using clean and open
    source code serves multiple purposes at once: to develop intuition about the models in order to
    inspire new ones, to enable tinkerable science such that curious people with relatively
    elementary coding skills may explore new avenues, and to spread these notions to a greater
    number by embedding implementations of these models directly in Web documents explaining them.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, the application below embeds a simple implementation of the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model">Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld</a> model of
    sandpile avalanches, alongside a log-log graph plotting the distribution of avalanche sizes as
    grains of sand are dropped on the table. On its own it does not add that much (and repainting
    each grain as it changes makes it too slow to study any larger system). It can, however, easily
    be modified to run outside the browser, or to study other aspects of the system such as the
    distribution of the times that grains spend on the table before falling off one side. The same
    core code can be used for both research and outreach.

    My hope is, to put it in Leibniz’s words, that «<em>by this means there is obtained as great
    variety as possible, along with the greatest possible order; that is to say, it is the way to
    get as much perfection as possible.</em>» <span class="end">•</span>
