  <p>
    Research as to whether reading on paper or on screens remains so far relatively inconclusive. In
    the absence of clear-cut results, it strikes me as intuitively true nevertheless that both have their
    advantages. Ebooks feature precious capabilities such as obtaining word definitions with a touch
    of one’s finger and extracting highlights and marginalia in electronic form; and they are far
    more convenient than a suitcase half-filled with books. Paper, however, has its topography.
    When digging into a complex text, it is easier to trace one’s steps through reasoning that spans
    several pages. It is easier to flip a few pages to get a sense of whether the author is drawing
    their point to a close with the chapter or still has further arguments to make. Scribbling in
    the margins with a pencil also somehow feels of greater engagement with the author than typing
    in annotations. Such non-textual cues bolster the reading experience and likely help it stick.

    The idea of the Symbook is that we can get the convenience of ebooks and the physicality of
    paper books all at once.

    The increased availability of flexible electronics leads to this very simple concept: a book
    made exclusively of sheets of flexible screens. Depending on one’s favoured book heft it can
    come in various sizes and different number of pages.

    When a book is loaded into the Symbook it is rendered across all the pages. Naturally, books
    are unlikely to make use of exactly the available number of pages but this minor inconvenience
    does not detract much from the improved experience. Shorter books simply stop early (and the
    remaining pages can be made visibly empty, e.g. with a dark side, so as not to lose the sense
    of location), longer books can be split into volumes.

    Additionally, touch or stylus modalities can support all of the interactions one expects from a
    books, be it dictionary lookup or scribbling.

    Granted, such a device would as of today be expensive, may appear gratuitous, and would no doubt
    require a substantial battery. But as an archetype I think it worth pondering. Over the past
    decades the digital world has progressively weaned itself from mimicking the analog and has
    developed interfaces all its own that fit our intuitions at times better than analog objects
    ever have. These improvements need not stay confined to our screens, they should flow back into
    the analog until we cease to know the difference. <span class="end">•</span>
