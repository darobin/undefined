  <p>
    MOOCs have done more than any other modern system to propagate, entrench, and magnify the
    mistakes, tropes, and blinds spots of academic teaching.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the broad and largely free availability of knowledge is undoubtedly progress, MOOCs today
    are little more than videoed courses with multiple-choice questions. If we take into account the
    fact that the constraints that produced the traditional course organisation do not necessarily
    apply on the Web, we can open the door to innovation in learning that can not only improve
    learning for all, but more specifically for some who have fared poorly in academic settings.
    There have been some interesting experiments (<a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/">mooculus</a>
    for instance) but there remains much to be done.
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin with, delivery formats need to be varied. It was once believed that television would
    revolutionise learning by making courses available to all; while this largely failed to become
    a reality MOOCs are nevertheless now using the Web as a more convenient VHS delivery service.
    Text-based courses, where applicable with embedded interactive content, can prove more
    convenient for some topics or for some students. It is much easier to pace one’s reading to
    match one’s understanding. Audiobooks are also a highly popular medium, and they can be listened
    to while carrying out relatively automatic tasks, yet listening to the audio of existing MOOCs
    will often lead to frustration as the lecturer regularly refers to material being presented
    visually. Needless to say, a multi-support approach also leads to better accessibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    The notion that a lecture ought to fit neatly inside of an hour is another constraint that no
    longer applies. While courses developed specifically for MOOCs have generally departed from this
    arrangement, they have yet to take the next logical step. Courses are still designed as
    multiple-week affairs aiming to increase one’s proficiency in a specific discipline. A student
    wishing to learn a single notion will likely have to wade through a lot of material before
    pinpointing it, assuming the course is even continuously available and not restricted to
    time-bound sessions much in the way that 20th century television used to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to enable bite-sized learning. One should be able to find and study a course on just the
    specific topic that one wishes to learn about. If that specific course builds upon other topics
    that one may need to become familiar with first, these can be made available through a
    technology that seems to have yet to revolutionise the MOOC universe: hypertext links. Of
    course, there is no reason why a set of bite-sized lessons could not still be listed as
    a complete, coherent, and long session for users who prefer it that way; it is simply required
    that they be individually discoverable and accessible. The ideal course should be a
    «<em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>» process.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many ways we are missing a manner of Wikipedia for learning. Wikipedia is a great reference
    but anyone who has tried to pick up an advanced topic from it is likely to have noted that it
    can prove lacking in pedagogy.
  </p>
  <p>
    When teaching through a MOOC, I saw first-hand how powerful the interactions in the community of
    students were and how much they helped people learn. But they only served those who managed to
    study at the course’s pace. Since it was a time-bound MOOC those who fell behind often found it
    doubly daunting to have to catch up with the forum discussions in addition to the course
    material itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    More fluid teaching formats would also help foster more helpful communities of learning, which
    could also serve as differentiators between the companies that compete in this space. Students
    could set up pace groups that would allow those who so desire to synchronise the speed at which
    they go through a longer course session. The
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> family of sites have shown that
    user-curated Q&amp;A can work well.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can really make the world a place of learning; we’ve brought the courses to the Web, now we
    need to bring the Web into the courses. <span class="end">•</span>
