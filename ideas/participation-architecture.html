    The question of how to organise groups into a harmonious, cooperative ensemble is not new. But
    whereas frameworks for instance described in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_%28Aristotle%29">Aristotle’s
    <cite>Politics</cite></a> or experimented with in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanst%C3%A8re">Fourier’s Phalanstère</a> tended towards
    requiring the full commitment of one’s energies, the appearance of the Web has made tinkering
    with collective organisation much easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    And tinker we have. There are not enough clichés in the world to convey the impact that the Web
    has had on social experimentation. Yet, for the most part, we have done so naïvely. In saying
    this I point no fingers. In 2010 I published a short booklet called <a
    href="http://www.fondapol.org/etude/berjon-internet-politique-coproduction-citoyenne/"><cite>Internet,
    politique et coproduction citoyenne</cite></a> («Internet, Politics, and Citizen Coproduction»,
    later re-edited as part of <a
    href="http://www.puf.com/Autres_Collections:Innovation_politique_2012"><cite>Innovation
    Politique 2012</cite></a> with the <a href="http://www.puf.com/Accueil">Presses Universitaires
    de France</a>) which described issues with how French political parties made use of the Web and
    proposed a model for citizens to take part in legislative production derived from the manner in
    which the open standards of the Web are produced. It is safe to say that it was just as naïve as
    anyone else’s.
  </p>
  <p>
    For all that we may have been retrospectively innocent, I see no reason to cast off optimism.
    Research into social networking has much improved. Reading <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">Milgram’s experiment</a> from fifty years
    ago and contrasting it with the research being carried out today based on massive amounts of
    human networking information is heartening. Google’s success in search can, perhaps with a pinch
    of salt, be seen as little more than applied sociology. Our understanding of the structure of
    society and of the flow of information through it is blossoming; and there is much more to be
    built from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet the core question remains: <em>How do we design for participation?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is time to turn research into action and to find out how we can convert analysis into actual
    design decisions for collective services. For instance, if it were to surface that successful
    collective services are systematically structured around a <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">Small-World network</a>, the question
    would become: how do we design interactions and structure the flow of information such that a
    Small-World network would naturally emerge in the service? And mutatis mutandis for any other
    such finding.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is no easy task. Facebook for instance is clearly floundering in its attempt to make its
    timeline — an unstructured all-to-one feature — usable despite the actual connections between
    its users having a genuine social topology. Knowing what works does not necessarily tell us how
    to build it.
  </p>
  <p>
    A programme to explore this space need not start by boiling the ocean. On the contrary, creating
    small, targeted endeavours (on or off the Web) to experiment with modest but world-improving
    goals should progressively help inform the emerging craft of participation architecture. <span
