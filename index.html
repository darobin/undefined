<section id="intro">
  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/about/faculty-search">faculty search posting</a> requested
    someone «<span class="q">deeply versed in a minimum of two fields</span> ». In my case, it is
    very precisely two: “<strong>Web technology</strong>” taken in a broad sense that reaches across numerous
    domains, and “<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>”. I am particularly good at the latter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason I must apply for this position is simple: while my work on the Web already
    covers much ground (from graphics to wire formats, from prototyping to negotiation,
    with technology as a social science), my interests are broader. As a result, many ideas that
    occur to me have to lay unbaked in notebooks, many areas of interest have to lay fallow and
    make do with what time I can marshall after work and family have been accounted for.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I do make slow progress on these topics and have seen some limited successes, it is
    frustrating. I spoil to be a tinkering philosopher by day, not just after mild-mannered citizens
    have gone to bed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I include a short selection of ideas and an overview of my reading pile in the hope to entice
    you to join my curiosity.

  <h2>Boltzmann Replicators</h2>
  <p>
    In his <cite>Meditations</cite>, Descartes’ “Malin Génie” has him live in a radically
    solipsistic world in which not only do other people not exist but one is nothing other than mind
    tricked into believing it has a body moving about the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The “Boltzmann Brain” is modern cosmology’s take on this idea, with a cold, uncaring,
    high-entropy universe stepping in as a more contemporary take on the evil demon. It stems from
    Ludwig Boltzmann’s hypothesis that the world in which we live is a (large) random fluctuation
    towards lower entropy leading to spontaneous and extremely improbable order. Assuming a
    distribution of such fluctuations that makes their likelihood inversely proportional to their
    size and complexity, it would seem to be a <em>lot</em> more statistically likely that you, dear
    reader, are nothing more than a self-aware fluctuation operating under the delusion that it is
    living in a genuine universe rather than being an actual being in a fluctuation of universe
    proportions. Put differently, a mind, full of thoughts, memories, and perceptions, is
    (obviously) orders of magnitude simpler than the entirety of the universe — it is, under this
    thought experiment, therefore orders of magnitude more likely to exist on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am not convinced that order is, in fact, improbable. Going over (for instance) Stuart
    Kauffman’s experiments as detailed in <cite>The Origins of Order</cite>, it seems at least
    conceivable that thermodynamics are only telling part of the story. Having said that, with the
    pleasure of staying within the confines of the thought experiment, I wonder if there is not
    possibly a more powerful consequence.
  </p>
  <p>
    A mind is already something inordinately complex for a purely stochastic fluctuation to produce.
    I wonder if, in the amount of time required for a mind to fluctuate into existence, something
    far simpler would not have had a chance to emerge, with far greater impact. A structure the only
    interesting property of which being that it is able to make use of the tiny amount of background
    energy surrounding it to do just one thing: making copies of itself. A <em>replicator</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A “Boltzmann Replicator”, assuming it is possible, would engender energy gradients. It would
    multiply, mutate, diversify, compete, evolve. After a while, long but much shorter than ergodic
    timescales, a universe might even come out of it.
