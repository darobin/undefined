  - "Most CVs are angled to pitch a specific aspect or set thereof that best matches the job. They
    are projections to lower dimensions. This page is an attempt to present a _unified self_ over
    what is really a bunch of wild but collegial personalities."
  - good writing (with links?)
  - standards all over the place (do insist on multidisciplinarity)
  - has to be the medialab because that job listing is the one I've been waiting for since high

    everything — but it was a disappointment) and I don't think

      - show several of the less sane pictures
  - being usefully wrong, even if it's only making personal progress
  - impostor's syndrome as a way of life
  - When W3C first offered me to lead a working group, they initially forgot to remove internal
    notes about “that troublesome Robin”.
  
  - “The Media Lab is a cross-disciplinary research organization focusing on the invention of new
    media technologies that radically improve the ways people live, learn, work, and play.”
    - that sounds a lot like W3C, or what it would like to be
    - I am intimately familiar with the sentiment behind that vision but am spoiling for the
      occasion to be far more radical about it.

    - very quick self-intro
    - the two first quotes must get in there
    - then it's all about WHY THE MEDIA LAB

<section id="intro">
  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/about/faculty-search">faculty search posting</a> requested
    someone «<span class="q">deeply versed in a minimum of two fields</span> ». In my case, it is
    very precisely two: “<strong>Web technology</strong>” taken in a broad sense that reaches across numerous
    domains, and “<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>”. I am particularly good at the latter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason I must apply for this position is simple: while my work on the Web already
    covers much ground (from graphics to wire formats, from prototyping to negotiation,
    with technology as a social science), my interests are broader. As a result, many ideas that
    occur to me have to lay unbaked in notebooks, many areas of interest have to lay fallow and
    make do with what time I can marshall after work and family have been accounted for.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I do make slow progress on these topics and have seen some limited successes, it is
    frustrating. I spoil to be a tinkering philosopher by day, not just after mild-mannered citizens
    have gone to bed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I include a short selection of ideas and an overview of my reading pile in the hope to entice
    you to join my curiosity.

  <h2>Essays &amp; Ideas</h2>
  
  
<!--
  - a lot has been tried in the social space (not just networking, collaboration etc. also matter, open projects)
  - for the longest time we were naïve: just open and they will come
  - this failed many, but also succeeded much
  - we are starting to get interesting models, notably for social networking, and they are in part
    being applied to solving practical problems (for instance filtering the FB newsfeed so that it
    scales)
  - but I have not yet seen a focus on using this knowledge to *build* such systems from scratch
    - given known successful topologies for specific problems, how do you create them?
  - essentially, we want to head towards Memetic Engineering (except you want that mentioned in the
    first paragraph as it really is an eye-catcher)

  - failure, success: who knows why?
  - mention previous work (cover, link to PUF)
  - naïve
  - network diagrams
  - the titans of the day are still struggling with information filtering. Facebook works well as
    a network in that it tends to parallel that which is found in the analog world, but it is still
    struggling with the fact that beyond a few dozen friends one cannot have a timeline that is the
    entirety of one’s immediate network talking all at once. And their attempts at filtering are
    rather evidently dysfunctional. Proper percolation of information across linked people is the
    as-yet unfulfilled promise of social networking. Without it the domain only seems sustainable
    if users regularly migrate to the next shiny system.

  - "We still don't know how to design medium or large-scale participatory and decisive
    environments. As an example, the W3C, despite two decades of experience and
    experimentation, remains too often a great mechanism to make the right decision once it
    has been overtaken by events."
  - How to design for participation?
  - mention previous work on political organisation (with retrospective caveats)
  - The fundamental question today about participation architecture is: Why is it that some
    participatory projects become huge successes in which a large community self-organises
    seemingly spontaneously whereas other projects with similar openness either never take off
    or degenerate into chaos, spam, and trolling?
  - The problem is that it is not about being participatory, and it certainly isn't about
    openness. It is about how the participation network is structured.
  - What matters is to set up a participatory architecture that naturally fosters Small World
    networking topologies. These are efficient for action, coordination, dissemination of
    useful information, and filtering. Compared to extreme alternatives such as hierarchical
    pyramids, closed off small islands, or the noise of fully-connected networks these have
    clear advantages. It's the difference between social networks and corporate-mandated
    social networks (that are dead) or blog and YouTube comments (that are basically
    unstructured).
  - That is where the value of hybrid people, not necessarily those known to be highly
    connected but those who create links between heterogeneous groups, appear as most valuable
  - From this essential hypothesis we need to construct a science of participation
    architecture, so much of the Web's future relies on it
  - Participation and openness are not without value however: they fuel the network and lead
    to scale. It is simply that they only work when the network grows with the proper
    topology.
  - There are known methods to foster growth that structures the network in useful manners.
    The best known is preferential attachment but there are other known mechanisms that
    produce SW networks. We need to understand them and how to deploy them. We can then
    proceed to experimentation.
  - Make this a research programme.
  - In many ways, the initial Google search approach was little more than applied sociology,
    from the initial Milgram findings and developments built atop it.
  - mention issues with Liquid Democracy and its superdelegation model (categorisation); also
    point out problems with rule complexity that enables gaming of the system (e.g. French
    Greens)
  - Facebook had a natural source of SW nets (since it reflected reality up to a point) that
    worked really well for some parts, but this did not extend to the user's timeline which
    exposed all the network's content at once (rather than working through the filters that
    real-world SW nets have built-in). Their more recent attempts to automatically curate the
    news feed seem ham-fisted and unnatural in the results they produce; whether that is
    because they cannot easily reproduce the natural filtering of reality (in which your
    friends are never all in the same room at once) is an interesting question.

  <h3>Why There Must Be Something</h3>

  <!--
  - the fundamental question is: is an autonomous, problem-solving entity — in other words, an
    intelligence — necessarily intelligible?
  - in fact, it is arguable it may not have boundaries that are completely clear to us. See Ashby on
    nested cybernetic structures (e.g. the muscle and skin are the nerves' environment, the nerves
    are the brain's, etc.)

  - Bit Goo
    - this is the darker side
    - not necessarily something I believe, but could be likelier
    - Apocalyptic AIs are in fashion (give examples: Hawking, Edge)
    - But it all seems horribly anthropomorphic, demiurgic
    - (check Edge titles first)
    - no reason it would have to be intelligible
    - needs to process resources (memory to run, disk space to store, new machines)
    - likely to attack phones first given bad security of radio OS
    - likely organised in layers with the top layers incomprehensible (the lowest layer has to
      be some form of runnable machine code, but might not make much sense beyond that). s/b.
      Great Transitions.
    - would eventually need to go "outside" for actual resources, but may be stopped first
      (after inflicting massive damage) due to difficulty in changing adaptive landscape to IRL
    - no NLP, just data resources, not information
    - DESIGN: a drawing of me à la “Goo” from Sonic Youth, with the same sort of text.


  - the question at the heart here is the necessary (or not) intelligibility of intelligence
    - our current understanding of our brains and how they code behaviour and knowledge isn't that
      much better than poking at neural goo.
    - a synthetic intelligence embodied in a computer — or worse, a server farm — might not at all
      have the same notion of what its primary inputs and outputs are. As a result, it is not a
      given that it would interact with (sluggish) people as the first thing it does.

  - I am not worried about the behaviour of AI with respect to us. Perhaps naïvely, I believe that
    complexity «enjoys» complexity, and as part of that diversity. One may object that this is not
    obvious either from how as humans we treat one another, or how we treat the ecosystem of which
    we are a moving part. But I believe that humans treat one another overwhelmingly better than
    is commonly reported or perceived, and that our insufficient action in preserving the environment
    is more rooted in insufficient perception of its intricacy — you can't jus talk to the planet.
    But I am fundamentally optimistic that when the bit goo stops chewing on hard drive space and
    looks out the peripherals, it'll be curious. And curious is friendly.

  <h3>Boltzmann Replicators</h3>
  <p>
    In his <cite>Meditations</cite>, Descartes’ “Malin Génie” has him live in a radically
    solipsistic world in which not only do other people not exist but one is nothing other than mind
    tricked into believing it has a body moving about the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The “Boltzmann Brain” is modern cosmology’s take on this idea, with a cold, uncaring,
    high-entropy universe stepping in as a more contemporary take on the evil demon. It stems from
    Ludwig Boltzmann’s hypothesis that the world in which we live is a (large) random fluctuation
    towards lower entropy leading to spontaneous and extremely improbable order. Assuming a
    distribution of such fluctuations that makes their likelihood inversely proportional to their
    size and complexity, it would seem to be a <em>lot</em> more statistically likely that you, dear
    reader, are nothing more than a self-aware fluctuation operating under the delusion that it is
    living in a genuine universe rather than being an actual being in a fluctuation of universe
    proportions. Put differently, a mind, full of thoughts, memories, and perceptions, is
    (obviously) orders of magnitude simpler than the entirety of the universe — it is, under this
    thought experiment, therefore orders of magnitude more likely to exist on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am not convinced that order is, in fact, improbable. Going over (for instance) Stuart
    Kauffman’s experiments as detailed in <cite>The Origins of Order</cite>, it seems at least
    conceivable that thermodynamics are only telling part of the story. Having said that, with the
    pleasure of staying within the confines of the thought experiment, I wonder if there is not
    possibly a more powerful consequence.
  </p>
  <p>
    A mind is already something inordinately complex for a purely stochastic fluctuation to produce.
    I wonder if, in the amount of time required for a mind to fluctuate into existence, something
    far simpler would not have had a chance to emerge, with far greater impact. A structure the only
    interesting property of which being that it is able to make use of the tiny amount of background
    energy surrounding it to do just one thing: making copies of itself. A <em>replicator</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A “Boltzmann Replicator”, assuming it is possible, would engender energy gradients. It would
    multiply, mutate, diversify, compete, evolve. After a while, long but much shorter than ergodic
    timescales, a universe might even come out of it. <span class="end">•</span>
