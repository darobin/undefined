  - "tinkering philosopher"
  - "rigorous curiosity and weather-hardened practice"
  - Adversarial design?
  - "Most CVs are angled to pitch a specific aspect or set thereof that best matches the job. They
    are projections to lower dimensions. This page is an attempt to present a _unified self_ over
    what is really a bunch of wild but collegial personalities."
  - good writing (with links?)
  - standards all over the place (do insist on multidisciplinarity)
  - has to be the medialab because that job listing is the one I've been waiting for since high
    school (went into philosophy because I thought it would be the only place that could touch on
    everything — but it was a disappointment) and I don't think
  - fearless: I don't mind being wrong, I've made a career out of picking jobs I was unqualified
    for before starting on them, I don't mind going on stage topless...
      - show several of the less sane pictures
  - being usefully wrong, even if it's only making personal progress
  - impostor's syndrome as a way of life
  - When W3C first offered me to lead a working group, they initially forgot to remove internal
    notes about “that troublesome Robin”.
  
  - “The Media Lab is a cross-disciplinary research organization focusing on the invention of new
    media technologies that radically improve the ways people live, learn, work, and play.”
    - that sounds a lot like W3C, or what it would like to be
    - I am intimately familiar with the sentiment behind that vision but am spoiling for the
      occasion to be far more radical about it.
      
  FOCUS:
    - very quick self-intro
    - the two first quotes must get in there
    - then it's all about WHY THE MEDIA LAB

<section id="intro">
  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/about/faculty-search">faculty search posting</a> requested
    someone “<span class="q">deeply versed in a minimum of two fields</span>”. In my case, it is
    very precisely two: “<strong>Web technology</strong>” taken in a broad sense that reaches across numerous
    domains, and “<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>”. I am particularly good at the latter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason I must apply for this position is simple: while my work on Web technology already
    touches upon numerous domains (from graphics to wire formats, from prototyping to negotiation,
    with technology as a social science), my interests are broader. As a result, many ideas that
    occur to me have to lay unbaked in notebooks, many areas of interest have to lay fallow and
    make do with what time I can marshall after work and family have been accounted for.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I do make slow progress on these topics and have seen some limited successes, it is
    frustrating. I spoil to be a tinkering philosopher by day, not just after mild-mannered citizens
    have gone to bed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I include a short selection of ideas and an overview of my reading pile in the hope to entice
    you to join my curiosity.

          a big B&W abstract image that spreads across here might look nice
          give some height, use a background (perhaps just on the nav)
          or perhaps not B&W but single-colour+white, could have a nice effect
          perhaps put is right under title, then centred nav under image. it avoids the text bits crossing the beams
          
          need a better colour for links
