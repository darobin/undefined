    The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/about/faculty-search">faculty search posting</a> requested
    someone «<span class="q">deeply versed in a minimum of two fields</span> ». In my case, it is
    very precisely two: «<strong>Web technology</strong>» taken in a broad sense that reaches across numerous
    domains, and «<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>». I am particularly good at the latter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason I must apply for this position is simple: while my work on the Web already
    covers much ground (from graphics to wire formats, from prototyping to negotiation,
    with technology as a social science), my interests are broader. As a result, many ideas that
    occur to me have to lay unbaked in notebooks, many areas of interest have to lay fallow and
    make do with what time I can marshall after work and family have been accounted for.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I do make slow progress on these topics and have seen some limited successes, it is
    frustrating. I spoil to be a tinkering philosopher by day, not just after mild-mannered citizens
    have gone to bed.

  <p>
    I include a short selection of ideas and an overview of my reading pile in the hope to entice
    you to join my curiosity.

  <p>
    The question of how to organise groups into a harmonious, cooperative ensemble is not new. But
    whereas frameworks for instance described in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_%28Aristotle%29">Aristotle’s
    <cite>Politics</cite></a> or experimented with in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanst%C3%A8re">Fourier’s Phalanstère</a> tended towards
    requiring the full commitment of one’s energies, the appearance of the Web has made tinkering
    with collective organisation much easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    And tinker we have. There are not enough clichés in the world to convey the impact that the Web
    has had on social experimentation. Yet, for the most part, we have done so naïvely. In saying
    this I point no fingers. In 2010 I published a short booklet called <a
    href="http://www.fondapol.org/etude/berjon-internet-politique-coproduction-citoyenne/"><cite>Internet,
    politique et coproduction citoyenne</cite></a> («Internet, Politics, and Citizen Coproduction»,
    later re-edited as part of <a
    href="http://www.puf.com/Autres_Collections:Innovation_politique_2012"><cite>Innovation
    Politique 2012</cite></a> with the <a href="http://www.puf.com/Accueil">Presses Universitaires
    de France</a>) which described issues with how French political parties made use of the Web and
    proposed a model for citizens to take part in legislative production derived from the manner in
    which the open standards of the Web are produced. It is safe to say that it was just as naïve as
    anyone else’s.
  </p>
  <p>
    For all that we may have been retrospectively innocent, I see no reason to cast off optimism.
    Research into social networking has much improved. Reading <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">Milgram’s experiment</a> from fifty years
    ago and contrasting it with the research being carried out today based on massive amounts of
    human networking information is heartening. Google’s success in search can, perhaps with a pinch
    of salt, be seen as little more than applied sociology. Our understanding of the structure of
    society and of the flow of information through it is blossoming; and there is much more to be
    built from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet the core question remains: <em>How do we design for participation?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is time to turn research into action and to find out how we can convert analysis into actual
    design decisions for collective services. For instance, if it were to surface that successful
    collective services are systematically structured around a <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">Small-World network</a>, the question
    would become: how do we design interactions and structure the flow of information such that a
    Small-World network would naturally emerge in the service? And mutatis mutandis for any other
    such finding.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is no easy task. Facebook for instance is clearly floundering in its attempt to make its
    timeline — an unstructured all-to-one feature — usable despite the actual connections between
    its users having a genuine social topology. Knowing what works does not necessarily tell us how
    to build it.
  </p>
  <p>
    A programme to explore this space need not start by boiling the ocean. On the contrary, creating
    small, targeted endeavours (on or off the Web) to experiment with modest but world-improving
    goals should progressively help inform the emerging craft of participation architecture. <span

  - There is a fine line between ambitious theorising and crackpot ideas. The ambition I have in
    approaching this topic is certainly well within the danger zone.
  - My planned approach is to start small and try to discover small improvements. The goal should
    remain bold, but progress should be made in steps.
  - The smallest starting point is to start reproducing a number of code experiments in which order
    appears out of randomness (Bak's avalanches or critical brain, Kauffman's NK models and random
    Boolean networks come to mind, s/b models) in a context that makes them hackable (and with simple
    explanations). The idea is to enable simple tinkering based on minimal expertise. This could
    enable not only better intuitions but also contribute to greater literacy on the topic.

  - HACK: Bak's avalanches here, as a demo? If so, make sure to put it close to the start of the
    article, and the article at the top of the essays

  - There have been many experiments showing that interesting order emerges from simple, random
    systems. In at least some cases, this order appears to be a major force in shaping what systems
    can arise and evolve naturally — including, according to SK in The Origins of Order, imposing
    limits on natural selection's power to shape beings.
  - If such emergent order is a fundamental force in the universe, there is no reason to believe that
    it may not act equally in many disparate parts of reality, in physics just as much as in biology;
    in fast mental processes just as much as in slow evolutionary ones.

  <p>
    We are making progress on cracking the brain’s own internal coding, but for the time being much
    of it is still a hodgepodge of signals. In this light, it may seem somewhat surprising that our
    expectations when things come to artificial intelligence are that it would be more or less
    instantly recognisable through its direct interactions with the channels we have built to
    interface with it. Our presumption that AI will be understandable is therefore rooted in the
    hope that when it emerges, it will prefer to interact through the peripherals that give it a
    direct interface to us rather than through other parts of its environment. How can we tell that,
    to an entity born into a computer, the hard drive, volatile memory, or network interface won’t
    be far more attractive than a webcam or keyboard input?
  </p>
  <p>
    We can’t. In fact, it is arguable that it may not have boundaries that are completely clear to
    us. In the same way that the brain’s immediate environment is the nervous system much more than
    the world external to us, a synthetic intelligence embodied in a computer — or in a server farm
    — might not at all share our notion of what its primary inputs and outputs are. As a result,
    it is not a given that it would be motivated to interact with (sluggish) people as the first
    thing it does.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the brain code looks like neural goo, then it is extremely likely that AI, when sprouting
    into existence, <em>even if it is not biomimetic</em>, will look like <em>bit goo</em>. For all
    we know, as an autonomous entity it could be drawn to expand to use as many computing resources
    as it can, exploiting the many security vulnerabilities present on connected devices, leaving an
    incomprehensible trail being of the digital equivalent of the grey goo found in apocalyptic
    nanotechnology fiction.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do not believe in such a catastrophic outbreak, even if I would not be surprised if the
    initial reach of a synthetic intelligence into the world were to clumsily break a few things.
    Perhaps naïvely, I believe that complexity «enjoys» complexity, and as part of that diversity.
    One may object that this is not obvious either from how as humans we treat one another, or how
    we treat the ecosystem of which we are a moving part. But humans treat each other overwhelmingly
    better than is commonly reported or perceived, and I intuit that our insufficient action in
    preserving the environment is rooted in our insufficient perception of its intricacy: you can’t
    just talk to the planet, its interaction web is a lot to take in. But I am fundamentally
    optimistic that when the bit goo stops chewing on hard drive space and looks out the
    peripherals, it will be curious. And curious is friendly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the meantime, the question of the necessary intelligibility of intelligence is open. How do
    we even notice that intelligence is happening when it might start happening much before it is
    able to meaningfully interact? I am curious to tinker in what we can extract from the neural
    goo with the hope that some of the mechanisms of its organisation might just be universal enough
    to deduce an intelligence test that could tease out nascent intelligence in bit goo.

  <h3>Web Schema</h3>

  <p>
    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_syndrome">Galápagos syndrome</a>,
    derived from Darwin’s observations of how species had walked down their own evolutionary path in
    the isolated environment of the Galápagos islands, was initially coined to describe the manner
    in which Japanese phones were for over a decade featuring advanced capabilities that were rarely
    spread abroad. It can however be equally well applied in other contexts. The French
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel">Minitel</a> is one such example. Semantic Web
    technologies are another, which is a major factor in their currently relatively limited
    deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet the necessity of a machine-processable Web of data is as real as ever. Open data continues
    to become massively available, but without an increase in widespread ability to process it
    easily its power goes largely untapped. The hugely diverse data sets that are bound to be
    produced by connected objects can only make the issue more pressing. Unused data is but a waste
    of bits, in order to enable a new generation of services on the Web we need to increase
    <em>data mungeability</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There have been improvements. JSON-LD has opened a tenuous bridge between Semantic Web
    technologies and run-of-the-mill Web development; ongoing work to turn sturdy old CSV into a
    first-class Web format will help further; and the slow but steady growth of Microdata and RDFa
    embedded in Web documents is slowly granting search engines power beyond text and links
    processing. But most of the benefits are so far being reaped by the large search engines rather
    than by a broader population. The <a href="http://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> can help,
    but only so far as data is published on typical Web sites.
  </p>
  <p>
    The causes behind this mismatch are not specific to Semantic Web technologies. As a community we
    need to become much better at <em>transition thinking</em>. It is never enough to just solve a
    problem by inventing technology: one also needs to know how to get people from here to there. In
    other words everyone might want a flying car, but if it requires years of intensive training to
    use it, no matter how great the antigrav engine, no matter how many dream of it, no matter that
    it may be enough to fend off global warming it will still fail. Technology is first and foremost
    a behavioural science.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of the <em>Web Schema</em> project is to reboot the Semantic Web by rooting a new batch
    of data technology in the vernacular of everyday Web development. The primary use case is to
    enable developers to start from what they typically already have — a JSON-based API — and allow
    them to enhance it iteratively in a manner that serves their immediate interests in producing
    Web content.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Web Schema models data in a manner that is at the natural intersection between JSON formats
    and HTML forms, with default rules that lend themselves to progressive enhancements (as opposed
    to having to produce a data ontology from scratch). Through this, it enables data validation on
    both the server (for security) and the client (for usability), it makes it possible to generate
    forms, to optimise database storage, and to document Web APIs. These features make Web Schema
    directly useful to developers, and by providing enhanced data descriptions in a manner that is
    built-in rather than bolted-on as with traditional metadata it provides a natural bootstrapping
    step to a Web of much higher quality data for all to use. <span class="end">•</span>

  <h3>Boltzmann Replicators</h3>
  <p>
    In his <cite>Meditations</cite>, Descartes’ «Malin Génie» has him live in a radically
    solipsistic world in which not only do other people not exist but one is nothing other than mind
    tricked into believing it has a body moving about the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The «Boltzmann Brain» is modern cosmology’s take on this idea, with a cold, uncaring,
    high-entropy universe stepping in as a more contemporary take on the evil demon. It stems from
    Ludwig Boltzmann’s hypothesis that the world in which we live is a (large) random fluctuation
    towards lower entropy leading to spontaneous and extremely improbable order. Assuming a
    distribution of such fluctuations that makes their likelihood inversely proportional to their
    size and complexity, it would seem to be a <em>lot</em> more statistically likely that you, dear
    reader, are nothing more than a self-aware fluctuation operating under the delusion that it is
    living in a genuine universe rather than being an actual being in a fluctuation of universe
    proportions. Put differently, a mind, full of thoughts, memories, and perceptions, is
    (obviously) orders of magnitude simpler than the entirety of the universe — it is, under this
    thought experiment, therefore orders of magnitude more likely to exist on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am not convinced that order is, in fact, improbable. Going over (for instance) Stuart
    Kauffman’s experiments as detailed in <cite>The Origins of Order</cite>, it seems at least
    conceivable that thermodynamics are only telling part of the story. Having said that, with the
    pleasure of staying within the confines of the thought experiment, I wonder if there is not
    possibly a more powerful consequence.
  </p>
  <p>
    A mind is already something inordinately complex for a purely stochastic fluctuation to produce.
    I wonder if, in the amount of time required for a mind to fluctuate into existence, something
    far simpler would not have had a chance to emerge, with far greater impact. A structure the only
    interesting property of which being that it is able to make use of the tiny amount of background
    energy surrounding it to do just one thing: making copies of itself. A <em>replicator</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A «Boltzmann Replicator», assuming it is possible, would engender energy gradients. It would
    multiply, mutate, diversify, compete, evolve. After a while, long but much shorter than ergodic
    timescales, a universe might even come out of it. <span class="end">•</span>
