  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/about/faculty-search">faculty search posting</a> requested
    someone «<span class="q">deeply versed in a minimum of two fields</span> ». In my case, it is
    very precisely two: «<strong>Web technology</strong>» taken in a broad sense that reaches across numerous
    domains, and «<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>». I am particularly good at the latter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason I must apply for this position is simple: I am spoiling to help bring about a better
    world, but my interests are more eclectic than can easily be brought to fruition within most
    existing structures. I am trying to implement this multifarious drive as a freelance tinkering
    philosopher, but progress has been slow with many ideas and areas of interest having to lay
    fallow as I build opportunities to tend to them step by step. Suffice it to say that finding out
    the Media Lab was opening just such a position, with no academic requirements, was electrifying.
  </p>
  <p>
    I include here a short selection of ideas. I make no claim that they are necessarily right, but
    I do believe that they have to potential to be usefully wrong and that with some rigorous
    curiosity and weather-hardened practice some could take a twisted and hopefully troublesome path
    to improving the world.

    I deliberately chose here not to describe a single, ready-to-go research programme. Instead, I
    sought to demonstrate a variety of short and somewhat rough ideas. My hope is not to add a brick
    to the Media Lab’s edifice but rather to plug into its full complexity, and through that to help
    beautiful new things into being, to help deliver the promises of our times.

    The question of how to organise groups into a harmonious, cooperative ensemble is not new. But
    whereas frameworks for instance described in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_%28Aristotle%29">Aristotle’s
    <cite>Politics</cite></a> or experimented with in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanst%C3%A8re">Fourier’s Phalanstère</a> tended towards
    requiring the full commitment of one’s energies, the appearance of the Web has made tinkering
    with collective organisation much easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    And tinker we have. There are not enough clichés in the world to convey the impact that the Web
    has had on social experimentation. Yet, for the most part, we have done so naïvely. In saying
    this I point no fingers. In 2010 I published a short booklet called <a
    href="http://www.fondapol.org/etude/berjon-internet-politique-coproduction-citoyenne/"><cite>Internet,
    politique et coproduction citoyenne</cite></a> («Internet, Politics, and Citizen Coproduction»,
    later re-edited as part of <a
    href="http://www.puf.com/Autres_Collections:Innovation_politique_2012"><cite>Innovation
    Politique 2012</cite></a> with the <a href="http://www.puf.com/Accueil">Presses Universitaires
    de France</a>) which described issues with how French political parties made use of the Web and
    proposed a model for citizens to take part in legislative production derived from the manner in
    which the open standards of the Web are produced. It is safe to say that it was just as naïve as
    anyone else’s.
  </p>
  <p>
    For all that we may have been retrospectively innocent, I see no reason to cast off optimism.
    Research into social networking has much improved. Reading <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">Milgram’s experiment</a> from fifty years
    ago and contrasting it with the research being carried out today based on massive amounts of
    human networking information is heartening. Google’s success in search can, perhaps with a pinch
    of salt, be seen as little more than applied sociology. Our understanding of the structure of
    society and of the flow of information through it is blossoming; and there is much more to be
    built from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet the core question remains: <em>How do we design for participation?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is time to turn research into action and to find out how we can convert analysis into actual
    design decisions for collective services. For instance, if it were to surface that successful
    collective services are systematically structured around a <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">Small-World network</a>, the question
    would become: how do we design interactions and structure the flow of information such that a
    Small-World network would naturally emerge in the service? And mutatis mutandis for any other
    such finding.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is no easy task. Facebook for instance is clearly floundering in its attempt to make its
    timeline — an unstructured all-to-one feature — usable despite the actual connections between
    its users having a genuine social topology. Knowing what works does not necessarily tell us how
    to build it.
  </p>
  <p>
    A programme to explore this space need not start by boiling the ocean. On the contrary, creating
    small, targeted endeavours (on or off the Web) to experiment with modest but world-improving
    goals should progressively help inform the emerging craft of participation architecture. <span

  <section id="why">
  <h3 id="why-h">Why There Must Be Something</h3>
  <p>
    I have a keen interest in the emergence of order, not within the study objects of a specific
    discipline but as a general topic. Eventually, I would like to answer the classic question:
    «<em>Why is there something rather than nothing?</em>».
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a fine line between ambitious theorising and crackpot ideas. The ambition I have in
    approaching this topic is certainly well within the danger zone. I am starting small and hoping
    to begin by discovering small improvements; departing neither from the bold goal nor from the
    contact of reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    My preferred starting point is to focus on simple code-based experiments (e.g. Per Bak’s
    avalanches or critical brain, Stuart Kauffman’s <var>NK</var> models or random boolean networks,
    John Holland’s signals/boundaries modes come to mind). Reproducing them using clean and open
    source code serves multiple purposes at once: to develop intuition about the models in order to
    inspire new ones, to enable tinkerable science such that curious people with relatively
    elementary coding skills may explore new avenues, and to spread these notions to a greater
    number by embedding implementations of these models directly in Web documents explaining them.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, the application below embeds a simple implementation of the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model">Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld</a> model of
    sandpile avalanches, alongside a log-log graph plotting the distribution of avalanche sizes as
    grains of sand are dropped on the table. On its own it does not add that much (and repainting
    each grain as it changes makes it too slow to study any larger system). It can, however, easily
    be modified to run outside the browser, or to study other aspects of the system such as the
    distribution of the times that grains spend on the table before falling off one side. The same
    core code can be used for both research and outreach.

    My hope is, to put it in Leibniz’s words, that «<span class="q">by this means there is obtained
    as great variety as possible, along with the greatest possible order; that is to say, it is the
    way to get as much perfection as possible.</span>» <span class="end">•</span>

  <h3 id="moocs-h">MOOCs off the Cowpath</h3>

  <p>
    MOOCs have done more than any other modern system to propagate, entrench, and magnify the
    mistakes, tropes, and blinds spots of academic teaching.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the broad and largely free availability of knowledge is undoubtedly progress, MOOCs today
    are little more than videoed courses with multiple-choice questions. If we take into account the
    fact that the constraints that produced the traditional course organisation do not necessarily
    apply on the Web, we can open the door to innovation in learning that can not only improve
    learning for all, but more specifically for some who have fared poorly in academic settings.
    There have been some interesting experiments (<a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/">mooculus</a>
    for instance) but there remains much to be done.
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin with, delivery formats need to be varied. It was once believed that television would
    revolutionise learning by making courses available to all; while this largely failed to become
    a reality MOOCs are nevertheless now using the Web as a more convenient VHS delivery service.
    Text-based courses, where applicable with embedded interactive content, can prove more
    convenient for some topics or for some students. It is much easier to pace one’s reading to
    match one’s understanding. Audiobooks are also a highly popular medium, and they can be listened
    to while carrying out relatively automatic tasks, yet listening to the audio of existing MOOCs
    will often lead to frustration as the lecturer regularly refers to material being presented
    visually. Needless to say, a multi-support approach also leads to better accessibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    The notion that a lecture ought to fit neatly inside of an hour is another constraint that no
    longer applies. While courses developed specifically for MOOCs have generally departed from this
    arrangement, they have yet to take the next logical step. Courses are still designed as
    multiple-week affairs aiming to increase one’s proficiency in a specific discipline. A student
    wishing to learn a single notion will likely have to wade through a lot of material before
    pinpointing it, assuming the course is even continuously available and not restricted to
    time-bound sessions much in the way that 20th century television used to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to enable bite-sized learning. One should be able to find and study a course on just the
    specific topic that one wishes to learn about. If that specific course builds upon other topics
    that one may need to become familiar with first, these can be made available through a
    technology that seems to have yet to revolutionise the MOOC universe: hypertext links. Of
    course, there is no reason why a set of bite-sized lessons could not still be listed as
    a complete, coherent, and long session for users who prefer it that way; it is simply required
    that they be individually discoverable and accessible.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many ways we are missing a manner of Wikipedia for learning. Wikipedia is a great reference
    but anyone who has tried to pick up an advanced topic from it is likely to have noted that it
    can prove lacking in pedagogy.
  </p>
  <p>
    When teaching through a MOOC, I saw first-hand how powerful the interactions in the community of
    students were and how much they helped people learn. But they only served those who managed to
    study at the course’s pace. Since it was a time-bound MOOC those who fell behind often found it
    doubly daunting to have to catch up with the forum discussions in addition to the course
    material itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    More fluid teaching formats would also help foster more helpful communities of learning, which
    could also serve as differentiators between the companies that compete in this space. Students
    could set up pace groups that would allow those who so desire to synchronise the speed at which
    they go through a longer course session. The
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> family of sites have shown that
    user-curated Q&amp;A can work well.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can really make the world a place of learning; we’ve brought the courses to the Web, now we
    need to bring the Web into the courses. <span class="end">•</span>

  <p>
    We are making progress on cracking the brain’s own internal coding, but for the time being much
    of it is still a hodgepodge of signals. In this light, it may seem somewhat surprising that our
    expectations when things come to artificial intelligence are that it would be more or less
    instantly recognisable through its direct interactions with the channels we have built to
    interface with it. Our presumption that AI will be understandable is therefore rooted in the
    hope that when it emerges, it will prefer to interact through the peripherals that give it a
    direct interface to us rather than through other parts of its environment. How can we tell that,
    to an entity born into a computer, the hard drive, volatile memory, or network interface won’t
    be far more attractive than a webcam or keyboard input?
  </p>
  <p>
    We can’t. In fact, it is arguable that it may not have boundaries that are completely clear to
    us. In the same way that the brain’s immediate environment is the nervous system much more than
    the world external to us, a synthetic intelligence embodied in a computer — or in a server farm
    — might not at all share our notion of what its primary inputs and outputs are. As a result,
    it is not a given that it would be motivated to interact with (sluggish) people as the first
    thing it does.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the brain code looks like neural goo, then it is extremely likely that AI, when sprouting
    into existence, <em>even if it is not biomimetic</em>, will look like <em>bit goo</em>. For all
    we know, as an autonomous entity it could be drawn to expand to use as many computing resources
    as it can, exploiting the many security vulnerabilities present on connected devices, and
    leaving an incomprehensible trail being of the digital equivalent of the grey goo found in
    apocalyptic nanotechnology fiction.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do not believe in such a catastrophic outbreak, even if I would not be surprised if the
    initial reach of a synthetic intelligence into the world were to clumsily break a few things.
    Perhaps naïvely, I believe that complexity «enjoys» complexity, and as part of that diversity.
    One may object that this is not obvious either from how as humans we treat one another, or how
    we treat the ecosystem of which we are a moving part. But humans treat each other overwhelmingly
    better than is commonly reported or perceived, and I intuit that our insufficient action in
    preserving the environment is rooted in our insufficient perception of its intricacy: you can’t
    just talk to the planet, its interaction web is a lot to take in. But I am fundamentally
    optimistic that when the bit goo stops chewing on hard drive space and looks outside its
    available peripherals, it will be curious. And curious is friendly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the meantime, the question of the necessary intelligibility of intelligence is open. How do
    we even notice that intelligence is happening when it might start happening much before it is
    able to meaningfully interact? I am curious to tinker in what we can extract from the neural
    goo with the hope that some of the mechanisms of its organisation might just be universal enough
    to deduce an intelligence test that could tease out nascent intelligence in bit goo.

  <section id="symbook">
  <h3 id="symbook-h">The Symbook</h3>

  <p>
    Research as to whether reading on paper or on screens remains so far relatively inconclusive. In
    the absence of clear-cut results, it strikes me as intuitively true nevertheless that both have their
    advantages. Ebooks feature precious capabilities such as obtaining word definitions with a touch
    of one’s finger and extracting highlights and marginalia in electronic form; and they are far
    more convenient than a suitcase half-filled with books. Paper, however, has its topography.
    When digging into a complex text, it is easier to trace one’s steps through reasoning that spans
    several pages. It is easier to flip a few pages to get a sense of whether the author is drawing
    their point to a close with the chapter or still has further arguments to make. Scribbling in
    the margins with a pencil also somehow feels of greater engagement with the author than typing
    in annotations. Such non-textual cues bolster the reading experience and likely help it stick.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea of the Symbook is that we can get the convenience of ebooks and the physicality of
    paper books all at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    The increased availability of flexible electronics leads to this very simple concept: a book
    made exclusively of sheets of flexible screens. Depending on one’s favoured book heft it can
    come in various sizes and different numbers of pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a book is loaded into the Symbook it is rendered across all the pages. Naturally, books
    are unlikely to make use of exactly the available number of pages but this minor inconvenience
    does not detract much from the improved experience. Shorter books simply stop early (and the
    remaining pages can be made visibly empty, e.g. with a dark side, so as not to lose the sense
    of location), longer books can be split into volumes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, touch or stylus modalities can support all of the interactions one expects from a
    book, be it dictionary lookup or scribbling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Granted, such a device would as of today be expensive, may appear gratuitous, and would no doubt
    require a substantial battery. But as an archetype I think it worth pondering. Over the past
    decades the digital world has progressively weaned itself from mimicking the analog and has
    developed interfaces all its own that fit our intuitions at times better than analog objects
    ever have. These improvements need not stay confined to our screens, they should flow back into
    the analog until we cease to know the difference. <span class="end">•</span>

<section id="boltzmann">
  <h3 id="boltzmann-h">Boltzmann Replicators</h3>
  <p>
    In his <cite>Meditations</cite>, Descartes’ «Malin Génie» has him live in a radically
    solipsistic world in which not only do other people not exist but one is nothing other than mind
    tricked into believing it has a body moving about the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The «Boltzmann Brain» is modern cosmology’s take on this idea, with a cold, uncaring,
    high-entropy universe stepping in as a more contemporary take on the evil demon. It stems from
    Ludwig Boltzmann’s hypothesis that the world in which we live is a (large) random fluctuation
    towards lower entropy leading to spontaneous and extremely improbable order. Assuming a
    distribution of such fluctuations that makes their likelihood inversely proportional to their
    size and complexity, it would seem to be a <em>lot</em> more statistically likely that you, dear
    reader, are nothing more than a self-aware fluctuation operating under the delusion that it is
    living in a genuine universe rather than an actual being in a fluctuation of universe-wide
    proportions. Put differently, a mind, full of thoughts, memories, and perceptions, is
    (obviously) orders of magnitude simpler than the entirety of the universe — it is, under this
    thought experiment, therefore orders of magnitude more likely to exist on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am not convinced that order is, in fact, improbable. Going over (for instance) Stuart
    Kauffman’s experiments as detailed in <cite>The Origins of Order</cite>, it seems at least
    conceivable that thermodynamics are only telling part of the story. Having said that, with the
    pleasure of staying within the confines of the thought experiment, I wonder if there is not
    possibly a more powerful consequence to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    A mind is already something inordinately complex for a purely stochastic fluctuation to produce.
    I wonder if, in the amount of time required for a mind to fluctuate into existence, something
    far simpler would not have had a chance to emerge, with far greater impact. A structure the only
    interesting property of which being that it is able to make use of the tiny amount of background
    energy surrounding it to do just one thing: make copies of itself. A <em>replicator</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A «Boltzmann Replicator», assuming it is possible, would engender energy gradients. It would
    multiply, mutate, diversify, compete, evolve. After a while, long but much shorter than ergodic
    timescales, a rich and structured universe might even come out of it. <span class="end">•</span>

  <p>
    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_syndrome">Galápagos syndrome</a>,
    derived from Darwin’s observations of how species had walked down their own evolutionary path in
    the isolated environment of the Galápagos islands, was initially coined to describe the manner
    in which Japanese phones were for over a decade featuring advanced capabilities that were rarely
    spread abroad. It can however be equally well applied in other contexts. The French
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel">Minitel</a> is one such example. Semantic Web
    technologies, having largely grown in isolation from the rest of Web technology, are another,
    which is a major factor in their currently relatively limited deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet the necessity of a machine-processable Web of data is as real as ever. Open data continues
    to become massively available, but without an increase in widespread ability to process it
    easily its power goes largely untapped. The hugely diverse data sets that are bound to be
    produced by connected objects can only make the issue more pressing. Unused data is but a waste
    of bits; in order to enable a new generation of services on the Web we need to increase
    <em>data mungeability</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There have been improvements. JSON-LD has opened a tenuous bridge between Semantic Web
    technologies and run-of-the-mill Web development; ongoing work to turn sturdy old CSV into a
    first-class Web format will help further; and the slow but steady growth of Microdata and RDFa
    embedded in Web documents is progressively granting search engines power beyond text and links
    processing. But most of the benefits are so far being reaped by the large search engines rather
    than by a broader population. The <a href="http://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> can help,
    but only so far as data is published on typical Web sites.
  </p>
  <p>
    The causes behind this mismatch are not specific to Semantic Web technologies. As a community we
    need to become much better at <em>transition thinking</em>. It is never enough to just solve a
    problem by inventing technology: one also needs to know how to get people from here to there. In
    other words everyone might want a flying car, but if it requires years of intensive training to
    use it, no matter how great the antigrav engine, no matter how many dream of it, no matter that
    it may be enough to fend off global warming it will still fail. Technology is first and foremost
    a behavioural science.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of the <em>Web Schema</em> project is to reboot the Semantic Web by rooting a new batch
    of data technology in the vernacular of everyday Web development. The primary use case is to
    enable developers to start from what they typically already have — a JSON-based API — and allow
    them to enhance it iteratively in a manner that serves their immediate interests in producing
    Web content.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Web Schema models data in a manner that is at the natural intersection between JSON formats
    and HTML forms, with default rules that lend themselves to progressive enhancements (as opposed
    to having to produce a data ontology from scratch). Through this, it enables data validation on
    both the server (for security) and the client (for usability), it makes it possible to generate
    forms, to optimise database storage, and to document Web APIs. These features make Web Schema
    directly useful to developers, and by providing enhanced data descriptions in a manner that is
    built-in rather than bolted-on (as with traditional metadata) it provides a natural
    bootstrapping step to a Web of much higher quality data for all to use. <span

  <h3 id="wocuments-h">Self-Editable Documents</h3>

  <p>
    Digital documents today come in either of two kinds. They can be <em>packaged documents</em>, in
    which case they are generally available as files on one’s hard drive, and can be copied and
    emailed around. Each type of packaged document requires a specialised application to view or
    edit them (often the same for both, but not necessarily). It is not uncommon for such
    applications to become bloated with features one does not need and to increase in complexity
    beyond the preferences of most users. A good example is Microsoft Office. Or they can be
    <em>hosted documents</em>, sitting on a third-party’s server. Hosted documents can frequently be
    shown to others who need not run anything other than a Web browser, but their content is in
    someone else’s keep with the obvious implications this has for security, privacy, and
    persistence. One instance of such an approach is Google Docs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We should not have to choose between ease of use and privacy, between universality and data
    ownership.
  </p>
  <p>
    Self-editable documents are documents that contain both their content and the implementation
    that makes it possible to render and edit them. Hosted documents have demonstrated that the Web
    platform is powerful enough for advanced document editing, and SEDs avail themselves of this
    capability. They are simply interactive Web content packaged up in a neat exchangeable file, and
    brought to life by a single runtime for all such documents which is essentially a browser view
    into the package. Carrying around the editing implementation with every document will have only
    a minor impact on size as the brunt of the complexity resides in the Web runtime; most editing
    environments can be supported with a few hundred kilobytes of JavaScript; the simpler ones with
    even less.
  </p>
  <p>
    One first value of SEDs is the diversity they enable: no matter how abstruse my choices in
    editing setup, I can still send others a document and they will be able to read it. This has
    an impact on archivability as well since a single format built atop Open Web technologies is
    essentially archivable in perpetuity, with no necessity to find a copy of a discontinued
    editor that only runs on an ancient operating system.
  </p>
  <p>
    This diversity also enables specialisation. Using the same editor for letters and novels,
    reports and speeches, specifications and articles, vector art and holiday cards leads to poor
    user experiences. Thanks to the format’s universality, one can have a very simple editor
    dedicated to letters and another, different one for structured long-form. And there is no need
    to remember which application is used for what type of file: a new document is created simply by
    copying an existing one and replacing the content, all documents of any type open in the same
    runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to foster a thriving ecosystem of SED types, it is possible for the rendering code to
    be runnable by all while the editing code requires the acquisition of a license. This maintains
    the universality of the format while providing economic incentives for the creation of high
    quality self-editable document types.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond simple convenience this approach is the only one that comes to mind with the ability to
    break the stranglehold of Microsoft, Adobe, Google, and other such large players over the
    document space. It can open the door to a renaissance in documents, for all users.

          I have been in charge of editing and shipping the <a
          href='http://w3.org/TR/html/'>HTML specification</a>, the core language of the Web, as
          well as a number of other Web technology projects. This requires technical acumen, a
          strong sense of where the Web platform should be going, and the ability to build bridges
          amongst a broad and highly varied group of people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The W3C had a relatively poor track record in both testing (which is core to ensuring an
          interoperable Web) and community engagement. In order to improve both, I launched and
          contributed extensively to the massive <a
          href='https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/'>Web Platform Tests</a> and <a
          href='http://testthewebforward.org/'>Test The Web Forward</a> projects, and started
          <a href='http://discourse.specifiction.org/'>Specifiction</a>, a platform for Web
          developers to contribute directly to the next generation of technological standards that
          they will be using.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there, I also contributed to several open source projects and am currently leading an
          effort to modernise the collaboration toolbox that is used by the thousands of contributors
          who work on improving the Web.

          As a freelancer, I offer a varied set of services but have gained most traction with
          technology companies. Work with the latter includes creating technology to enable
          open-standards applications on mobile devices for <a

          cameras or printers for <a href='http://www.canon.com/'>Canon</a>, or prototyping
          solutions for a new operating system for <a href='http://www.samsung.com/'>Samsung</a>. I
          also worked on using <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> to build interfaces

          I published a short book on the application of online open collaboration to the production

          I organise and run mini-conferences built on the «lightning talks» format (in which speakers
          can do whatever they please so long as it fits inside four minutes), including a session
          at the Web’s 25th anniversary celebrations. I pick speakers for variety and impact; topics
          have included how copyist monks used eye-tracking or how to build a Breakout game that can
          be played jointly by sighted and blind users,
          «<a href="https://vimeo.com/110965713">Design like we give a damn!</a>» (NetMag’s 2014
          Best Presentation) or how to cut up your pants to build a computer bag. I am starting a
          regular conference cycle based on thematic lightning talks followed by open debate with
          the <a href="http://letank.fr/">Le Tank</a> co-working space. I am also planning
          <a href="http://horsweb.org/">HorsWeb</a>, a conference in which Web practitioners come to
          present about <em>anything but</em> the Web.
