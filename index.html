<section id="intro">
  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/about/faculty-search">faculty search posting</a> requested
    someone «<span class="q">deeply versed in a minimum of two fields</span> ». In my case, it is
    very precisely two: “<strong>Web technology</strong>” taken in a broad sense that reaches across numerous
    domains, and “<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>”. I am particularly good at the latter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason I must apply for this position is simple: while my work on the Web already
    covers much ground (from graphics to wire formats, from prototyping to negotiation,
    with technology as a social science), my interests are broader. As a result, many ideas that
    occur to me have to lay unbaked in notebooks, many areas of interest have to lay fallow and
    make do with what time I can marshall after work and family have been accounted for.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I do make slow progress on these topics and have seen some limited successes, it is
    frustrating. I spoil to be a tinkering philosopher by day, not just after mild-mannered citizens
    have gone to bed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I include a short selection of ideas and an overview of my reading pile in the hope to entice
    you to join my curiosity.

  <p>
    The question of how to organise groups into a harmonious, cooperative ensemble is not new. But
    whereas frameworks for instance described in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_%28Aristotle%29">Aristotle’s
    <cite>Politics</cite></a> or experimented with in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanst%C3%A8re">Fourier’s Phalanstère</a> tended towards
    requiring the full commitment of one’s energies, the appearance of the Web has made tinkering
    with collective organisation much easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    And tinker we have. There are not enough clichés in the world to convey the impact that the Web
    has had on social experimentation. Yet, for the most part, we have done so naïvely. In saying
    this I point no fingers. In 2010 I published a short booklet called <a
    href="http://www.fondapol.org/etude/berjon-internet-politique-coproduction-citoyenne/"><cite>Internet,
    politique et coproduction citoyenne</cite></a> («Internet, Politics, and Citizen Coproduction»,
    later re-edited as part of <a
    href="http://www.puf.com/Autres_Collections:Innovation_politique_2012"><cite>Innovation
    Politique 2012</cite></a> with the <a href="http://www.puf.com/Accueil">Presses Universitaires
    de France</a>) which described issues with how French political parties made use of the Web and
    proposed a model for citizens to take part in legislative production derived from the manner in
    which the open standards of the Web are produced. It is safe to say that it was just as naïve as
    anyone else’s.
  </p>
  <p>
    For all that we may have been retrospectively innocent, I see no reason to cast off optimism.
    Research into social networking has much improved. Reading <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">Milgram’s experiment</a> from fifty years
    ago and contrasting it with the research being carried out today based on massive amounts of
    human networking information is heartening. Google’s success in search can, perhaps with a pinch
    of salt, be seen as little more than applied sociology. Our understanding of the structure of
    society and of the flow of information through it is blossoming; and there is much more to be
    built from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet the core question remains: <em>How do we design for participation?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is time to turn research into action and to find out how we can convert analysis into actual
    design decisions for collective services. For instance, if it were to surface that successful
    collective services are systematically structured around a <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">Small-World network</a>, the question
    would become: how do we design interactions and structure the flow of information such that a
    Small-World network would naturally emerge in the service? And mutatis mutandis for any other
    such finding.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is no easy task. Facebook for instance is clearly floundering in its attempt to make its
    timeline — an unstructured all-to-one feature — usable despite the actual connections between
    its users having a genuine social topology. Knowing what works does not necessarily tell us how
    to build it.
  </p>
  <p>
    A programme to explore this space need not start by boiling the ocean. On the contrary, creating
    small, targeted endeavours (on or off the Web) to experiment with modest but world-improving
    goals should progressively help inform the emerging craft of participation architecture. <span

  - There is a fine line between ambitious theorising and crackpot ideas. The ambition I have in
    approaching this topic is certainly well within the danger zone.
  - My planned approach is to start small and try to discover small improvements. The goal should
    remain bold, but progress should be made in steps.
  - The smallest starting point is to start reproducing a number of code experiments in which order
    appears out of randomness (Bak's avalanches or critical brain, Kauffman's NK models and random
    Boolean networks come to mind, s/b models) in a context that makes them hackable (and with simple
    explanations). The idea is to enable simple tinkering based on minimal expertise. This could
    enable not only better intuitions but also contribute to greater literacy on the topic.

  - HACK: Bak's avalanches here, as a demo?

  - There have been many experiments showing that interesting order emerges from simple, random
    systems. In at least some cases, this order appears to be a major force in shaping what systems
    can arise and evolve naturally — including, according to SK in The Origins of Order, imposing
    limits on natural selection's power to shape beings.
  - If such emergent order is a fundamental force in the universe, there is no reason to believe that
    it may not act equally in many disparate parts of reality, in physics just as much as in biology;
    in fast mental processes just as much as in slow evolutionary ones.

  - bite sized learning: it's silly to assume people will always want a full hour on a broad topic,
    let alone a whole course. People need to be able to learn just the smallest part, with links to
    dependencies; and of course it's possible to turn a set of bite-sized courses into a full course

  - the fundamental question is: is an autonomous, problem-solving entity — in other words, an
    intelligence — necessarily intelligible?
  - in fact, it is arguable it may not have boundaries that are completely clear to us. See Ashby on
    nested cybernetic structures (e.g. the muscle and skin are the nerves' environment, the nerves
    are the brain's, etc.)

  - Bit Goo
    - this is the darker side
    - not necessarily something I believe, but could be likelier
    - Apocalyptic AIs are in fashion (give examples: Hawking, Edge)
    - But it all seems horribly anthropomorphic, demiurgic
    - (check Edge titles first)
    - no reason it would have to be intelligible
    - needs to process resources (memory to run, disk space to store, new machines)
    - likely to attack phones first given bad security of radio OS
    - likely organised in layers with the top layers incomprehensible (the lowest layer has to
      be some form of runnable machine code, but might not make much sense beyond that). s/b.
      Great Transitions.
    - would eventually need to go "outside" for actual resources, but may be stopped first
      (after inflicting massive damage) due to difficulty in changing adaptive landscape to IRL
    - no NLP, just data resources, not information
    - DESIGN: a drawing of me à la “Goo” from Sonic Youth, with the same sort of text.


  - the question at the heart here is the necessary (or not) intelligibility of intelligence
    - our current understanding of our brains and how they code behaviour and knowledge isn't that
      much better than poking at neural goo.
    - a synthetic intelligence embodied in a computer — or worse, a server farm — might not at all
      have the same notion of what its primary inputs and outputs are. As a result, it is not a
      given that it would interact with (sluggish) people as the first thing it does.

  - I am not worried about the behaviour of AI with respect to us. Perhaps naïvely, I believe that
    complexity «enjoys» complexity, and as part of that diversity. One may object that this is not
    obvious either from how as humans we treat one another, or how we treat the ecosystem of which
    we are a moving part. But I believe that humans treat one another overwhelmingly better than
    is commonly reported or perceived, and that our insufficient action in preserving the environment
    is more rooted in insufficient perception of its intricacy — you can't jus talk to the planet.
    But I am fundamentally optimistic that when the bit goo stops chewing on hard drive space and
    looks out the peripherals, it'll be curious. And curious is friendly.
    
  - also try to resize image vertically so as to get good vertical rhythm
    
  - We don't care that it's in fashion, we really don't
    - find another angle to enter into the topic
    - the brain code
  
  - We still don't have an understanding of the Brain’s code; our presumption that AI will be
    understandable is therefore rooted in the hope that when it emerges, it will prefer to interact
    through the peripherals that give it a direct interface to us rather than through other parts of
    its environment. How can we tell that, to an entity born into a computer, the hard drive,
    volatile memory, or network interface won't be far more attractive than a webcam or keyboard
    input?
  - We can't. See Ashby when he says that the environment of the nerves is the muscle, skin, and
    bones; the environment for the brain is the nerves; and so on.
  - if the Brain Code looks like Goo, then it is extremely likely that AI, when sprouting into
    existence, *even if it is not modelled after biological systems*, will look like Bit Goo.
  - How do we go from there? How do we capture the intelligibility of intelligence?

  <h3>Boltzmann Replicators</h3>
  <p>
    In his <cite>Meditations</cite>, Descartes’ “Malin Génie” has him live in a radically
    solipsistic world in which not only do other people not exist but one is nothing other than mind
    tricked into believing it has a body moving about the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The “Boltzmann Brain” is modern cosmology’s take on this idea, with a cold, uncaring,
    high-entropy universe stepping in as a more contemporary take on the evil demon. It stems from
    Ludwig Boltzmann’s hypothesis that the world in which we live is a (large) random fluctuation
    towards lower entropy leading to spontaneous and extremely improbable order. Assuming a
    distribution of such fluctuations that makes their likelihood inversely proportional to their
    size and complexity, it would seem to be a <em>lot</em> more statistically likely that you, dear
    reader, are nothing more than a self-aware fluctuation operating under the delusion that it is
    living in a genuine universe rather than being an actual being in a fluctuation of universe
    proportions. Put differently, a mind, full of thoughts, memories, and perceptions, is
    (obviously) orders of magnitude simpler than the entirety of the universe — it is, under this
    thought experiment, therefore orders of magnitude more likely to exist on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am not convinced that order is, in fact, improbable. Going over (for instance) Stuart
    Kauffman’s experiments as detailed in <cite>The Origins of Order</cite>, it seems at least
    conceivable that thermodynamics are only telling part of the story. Having said that, with the
    pleasure of staying within the confines of the thought experiment, I wonder if there is not
    possibly a more powerful consequence.
  </p>
  <p>
    A mind is already something inordinately complex for a purely stochastic fluctuation to produce.
    I wonder if, in the amount of time required for a mind to fluctuate into existence, something
    far simpler would not have had a chance to emerge, with far greater impact. A structure the only
    interesting property of which being that it is able to make use of the tiny amount of background
    energy surrounding it to do just one thing: making copies of itself. A <em>replicator</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A “Boltzmann Replicator”, assuming it is possible, would engender energy gradients. It would
    multiply, mutate, diversify, compete, evolve. After a while, long but much shorter than ergodic
    timescales, a universe might even come out of it. <span class="end">•</span>
