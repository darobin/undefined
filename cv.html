          I have been in charge of editing and shipping the <a
          href='http://w3.org/TR/html/'>HTML specification</a>, the core language of the Web, as
          well as a number of other Web technology projects. This requires technical acumen, a
          strong sense of where the Web platform should be going, and the ability to build bridges
          amongst a broad and highly varied group of people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The W3C had a relatively poor track record in both testing (which is core to ensuring an
          interoperable Web) and community engagement. In order to improve both, I launched and
          contributed extensively to the massive <a
          href='https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/'>Web Platform Tests</a> and <a
          href='http://testthewebforward.org/'>Test The Web Forward</a> projects, and started
          <a href='http://discourse.specifiction.org/'>Specifiction</a>, a platform for Web
          developers to contribute directly to the next generation of technological standards that
          they will be using.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there, I also contributed to several open source projects and am currently leading
          an effort to modernise the collaboration toolbox that is used by the thousands of
          contributors who work on improving the Web.

          As a freelancer, I offer a varied set of services but have gained most traction with
          technology companies. Work with the latter includes creating technology to enable
          open-standards applications on mobile devices for <a
          href='http://vodafone.com/'>Vodafone</a>, imagining what happens if you bring the Web to
          cameras or printers for <a href='http://www.canon.com/'>Canon</a>, or prototyping
          solutions for a new operating system for <a href='http://www.samsung.com/'>Samsung</a>. I
          also worked on using <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> to build interfaces
          on very low-powered devices for <a href="http://www.igel.co.jp/">IGEL</a> or <a
          href="http://ikivo.com/">Ikivo</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I published a short book on the application of online open collaboration to the production
          of legislation with the <a href="http://www.fondapol.org/">Fondation pour l’Innovation
          Politique</a>: <a
 href="http://www.fondapol.org/etude/berjon-internet-politique-coproduction-citoyenne/">Internet,
          politique et coproduction citoyenne</a> (re-edited as part of <a
          href="http://www.puf.com/Autres_Collections:Innovation_politique_2012"><cite>Innovation
          Politique 2012</cite></a> with the <a href="http://www.puf.com/Accueil">Presses
          Universitaires de France</a>). I was invited to present my findings in the French
          parliament, and the publication was followed by a few conferences and workshops. I also
          contributed to the scientific board of the <a href="http://tnova.fr/">Terra Nova</a> think
          tank.
        </p>
        <p>
          I organise and run mini-conferences built on the «lightning talks» format (in which
          speakers can do whatever they please so long as it fits inside four minutes), including a
          session at the Web’s 25th anniversary celebrations. I pick speakers for variety and
          impact; topics have included how copyist monks used eye-tracking or how to build a
          Breakout game that can be played jointly by sighted and blind users, «<a
          href="https://vimeo.com/110965713">Design like we give a damn!</a>» (NetMag’s 2014 Best
          Presentation) or how to cut up your pants to build a computer bag. I am starting a regular
          conference cycle based on thematic lightning talks followed by open debate with the <a
          href="http://letank.fr/">Le Tank</a> co-working space. I am also planning <a
          href="http://horsweb.org/">HorsWeb</a>, a conference in which Web practitioners come to
          present about <em>anything but</em> the Web.
        </p>

          I also wrote and taught the “Mobile Web 2: Applications” course for the <a

          In 2012 I was elected to the W3C <a href='http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/'>Technical
          Architecture Group</a>, a small group charged with stewardship of the Web’s
          architecture.

          Joost was a platform for high-quality, peer-based, legal video distribution. While there I
          designed user interfaces using SVG, HTML, JavaScript, RDF, and XUL, and developed the
          widgets platform (format, API, and implementation) that allowed third-parties to enhance
          the Joost platform.

          As part of the research team, I worked on inventing efficient XML compression formats (now

          Vector Graphics. I started and chaired the W3C’s work on efficient XML interchange, and
          became an editor of the SVG specification.

          In 1996 I founded a Web agency that would eventually be present across three countries
          and become involved in a large variety of projects as the Web went through its earlier,
          fast-moving years. In addition to “classic” Web development, I also operated on more
          advanced projects such as an SVG map editor for the <a
          href='http://www.cete-mediterranee.fr/'>CETE</a> (French Ministry of Equipment),
          education software for Audi-Volkswagen, glossy sites for Elle Magazine or Bordeaux
          wines, multilingual publishing for Proximus, or an online trading system for the aerospace
          industry. I contributed extensively to open source development.

          I studied philosophy, but was quickly disillusioned with the content of the courses and
          the type of work that was expected from me. I did not complete the cycle, preferring
