  - "tinkering philosopher"
  - "rigorous curiosity and weather-hardened practice"
  - Adversarial design?
  - "Most CVs are angled to pitch a specific aspect or set thereof that best matches the job. They
    are projections to lower dimensions. This page is an attempt to present a _unified self_ over
    what is really a bunch of wild but collegial personalities."
  - good writing (with links?)
  - standards all over the place (do insist on multidisciplinarity)
  - has to be the medialab because that job listing is the one I've been waiting for since high
    school (went into philosophy because I thought it would be the only place that could touch on
    everything — but it was a disappointment) and I don't think

    - I am intimately familiar with the sentiment behind that vision but am spoiling for the
      occasion to be far more radical about it.

    The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/about/faculty-search">faculty search posting</a> requested
    someone “<span class="q">deeply versed in a minimum of two fields</span>”. In my case, it is
