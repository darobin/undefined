    The <a    href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150120192803/http://www.media.mit.edu/about/faculty-search">faculty
    search posting</a> requested someone «<span class="q">deeply versed in a minimum of two
    fields</span> ». In my case, it is very precisely two: «<strong>Web technology</strong>» taken
    in a broad sense that reaches across numerous domains, and «<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>». I
    am particularly good at the latter.

  <p>
    The reason I must apply for this position is simple: I am spoiling to help bring about a better
    world, but my interests are more eclectic than can easily be brought to fruition within most
    existing structures. I am trying to implement this multifarious drive as a freelance tinkering
    philosopher, but progress has been slow. Many of my ideas and areas of interest are having to
    lay fallow as I build opportunities to tend to them step by step. Suffice it to say that finding
    out the Media Lab was opening just such a position, with no academic requirements, was
    electrifying.

  <p>
    I include here a short selection of ideas. I make no claim that they are necessarily right, but
    I do believe that they have to potential to be usefully wrong. With some rigorous curiosity and
    weather-hardened practice some could take a twisted and hopefully troublesome path to improving
    the world.
